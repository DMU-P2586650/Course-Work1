           This will sound odd, but the <u> element isn't actually to underline text. It's to mark text as
           unarticulated, such as that which has been mispelled. The browser then chooses to apply an underline.

           My using <u> solely to get an underline, you're actually conveying a different meaning on your text. 

           Instead of using a <u> element, use the text-decoration CSS property.
